<h1>Being Myself</h1>
<h3><p id="context">My name is Meagan and welcome to my webpage!!!! I currently attend highschool, it is my first year and it isnt as bad as people made it out to be. I made alot of friends and I lost some. This isn't something to be too upset about, people are ut in your life to teach a lesson, make you happy, or both so try not to be too upset if this ever happens.
<p id="context-two">I live in bushwick which isn't that bad. Bushwick has new buildings and houses being built which is causing gentrification. This is fair or good because people get kicked out because they can't pay the rent and etc. As I was saying I walk two blocks to school everyday but im always late. I don't get enough sleep because my dog wakes me up so i take naps when i finish my school work. I hope to be very successful and help my family financially because to live anywhere these days is expensive. </p> <a>https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjP5O3Do7TiAhWPneAKHWJUCgUQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideschools.org%2Fschool%2F32K552&psig=A</a>
<p id="my-interest"> I take interest in volleyball, I find it extremely fun and I rarely get tired of it. I wanna play professionaly, keep learning about it and hopefully play on the team that I'm gonna try out for and hopefully get on. </p> <img src= "https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lindenwoodpark.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F10%2FVolleyball.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lindenwoodpark.org%2F2014-epiphany-co-ed-volleyball-tournament%2F&docid=_6AUwS2fhmhBlM&tbnid=sCek7eWeuIRI0M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwi91rKXqMPiAhURVd8KHV5YDr0QMwhCKAAwAA..i&w=259&h=194&safe=strict&bih=641&biw=1366&q=volleyball%20going%20over%20the%20net&ved=0ahUKEwi91rKXqMPiAhURVd8KHV5YDr0QMwhCKAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8">
